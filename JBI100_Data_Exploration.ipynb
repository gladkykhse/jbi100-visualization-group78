    "#### General Overall Goal\n",
    "The primary goal of the visualization tool is to **enable workplace safety analysts, policymakers, and industry leaders** to:\n",
    "1. Identify trends in workplace injuries and illnesses across industries, establishments, and job roles.\n",
    "2. Explore the temporal, geographic, and sector-specific distribution of incidents to identify patterns and potential risk factors.\n",
    "3. Facilitate decision-making by highlighting areas that require safety interventions, such as industries with high incident rates or recurring issues in specific job roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target Users\n",
    "The visualization tool is designed for:\n",
    "- **Workplace Safety Analysts**: To understand patterns in workplace incidents and investigate contributing factors.\n",
    "- **Policymakers**: To design and evaluate regulations that mitigate risks in high-hazard industries.\n",
    "- **Industry Leaders/Managers**: To assess their establishments’ performance compared to industry benchmarks and implement targeted safety measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Goal and High-Level Actions\n",
    "The primary goal is **\"Exploratory Analysis\"**, focusing on:\n",
    "1. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare incidents across industries, job roles, and geographic regions to identify high-risk categories.\n",
    "2. **Trend Identification**: Examine temporal trends in incident occurrences and severity (e.g., time of day, seasonality).\n",
    "3. **Insight Generation**: Drill down into specific establishments or job types to identify recurring patterns or anomalies.\n",
    "4. **Communication and Awareness**: Present findings in an intuitive, interactive format to raise awareness and drive action.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Goal is Suitable for the Available Data\n",
    "- The dataset contains a wealth of detailed information about workplace incidents, including establishment-level, incident-level, and job-level attributes. These can be visualized to uncover patterns and correlations that would be hard to identify otherwise.\n",
    "- While some attributes have missing values (e.g., `date_of_death`, `time_started_work`), the remaining data is sufficient to provide meaningful insights at industry, establishment, and incident levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Visualization is the Right Means\n",
    "1. **Pattern Recognition**: Visualization allows users to recognize patterns and outliers, such as industries with unusually high incident rates.\n",
    "2. **Exploration and Interaction**: An interactive tool enables users to explore the dataset from various perspectives (e.g., filtering by industry, geographic location, or incident severity).\n",
    "3. **Decision Support**: Visualizing data enables managers and policymakers to make informed decisions quickly by presenting complex data in an understandable format.\n",
    "4. **Communication**: Visualizations can convey insights effectively to diverse stakeholders, including non-technical audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is ideal for leveraging the available data to inform workplace safety improvements, reduce incident rates, and ensure compliance with regulations.\n"

    "#### Attributes Needed for the Analysis and Their Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Establishment-Level Attributes**:\n",
    "   - **`naics_code` and `industry_description`**: Essential for identifying high-risk industries and understanding sector-specific trends.\n",
    "   - **`state`, `city`, `zip_code`**: Crucial for geographic analysis to detect regional patterns or disparities in workplace safety.\n",
    "   - **`size`, `annual_average_employees`, and `total_hours_worked`**: Provide context for scaling incident data (e.g., incidents per employee or hours worked) to make comparisons meaningful across establishments of different sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Incident-Level Attributes**:\n",
    "   - **`date_of_incident`**: Key for temporal analysis, such as identifying trends over time or seasonal variations.\n",
    "   - **`type_of_incident`**: Important for categorizing and understanding the nature of incidents (e.g., injuries vs. illnesses).\n",
    "   - **`incident_outcome`**: Crucial for evaluating the severity of incidents and prioritizing interventions.\n",
    "   - **`dawf_num_away` and `djtr_num_tr`**: Provide metrics to assess the impact of incidents on productivity and employee health.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Narrative and Job-Level Attributes**:\n",
    "   - **`job_description`**: Helps identify which roles are most vulnerable to workplace incidents, enabling targeted interventions.\n",
    "   - **`SOC_code` and `SOC_description`**: Provide standard classifications for jobs, supporting cross-industry comparisons.\n",
    "   - **`incident_description` and `nar_what_happened`**: Offer qualitative insights into incident causes and circumstances, which are valuable for designing preventative measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **System Metadata**:\n",
    "   - **`year_of_filing`**: Allows analysis of data trends across multiple reporting years.\n",
    "   - **`created_timestamp`**: Ensures timeliness and relevance of the data used for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why These Attributes Are Relevant\n",
    "These attributes enable comprehensive analyses aligned with the goals of the visualization tool:\n",
    "- **Comparative Analysis**: Attributes like `naics_code`, `state`, and `incident_outcome` allow comparisons across industries, regions, and severity levels.\n",
    "- **Trend Identification**: Temporal attributes such as `date_of_incident` and `year_of_filing` help identify trends in workplace safety over time.\n",
    "- **Actionable Insights**: Narrative and job-level attributes (`job_description`, `SOC_code`, and `incident_description`) provide detailed insights into specific incident causes, enabling targeted interventions.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Workforce metrics (`size`, `annual_average_employees`, `total_hours_worked`) ensure that analyses are normalized, allowing for meaningful comparisons across establishments of varying sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on these attributes, the visualization tool can deliver actionable insights to workplace safety analysts, policymakers, and industry leaders.\n"
